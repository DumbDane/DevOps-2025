## Developing with Nix
This directory contains a `flake.nix` and its corresponding `flake.lock` file.

Developing using this flake requires nix with commands and flakes enabled.
To activate the flake run `nix develop`, with the optional `-c $SHELL` if you're using a shell other than bash, while inside this directory.
